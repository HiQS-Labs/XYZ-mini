  Adaptive daily planning skill that pivots the active weekly plan based on what closed
  yesterday. Directly reuses the core engine and adversarial Northstars from weekly-planner
  (skills/weekly-planner/) to eliminate logic drift and prevent planning contradictions.
  Re-sequences the daily merge queue and highlights the immediate blocker for the operator.

# Daily Planner (Adaptive Daily Pivot)

Adapts the active weekly plan based on yesterday's progress, landed PRs, and newly emerged blockers.

**Drift Prevention Contract:** This skill does NOT duplicate planning heuristics or merge algorithms. It directly executes the shared core engine at `skills/weekly-planner/scripts/planner_core.py` to ensure that daily tactical decisions remain 100% coherent with the weekly trajectory.

## Daily Workflow

### Step 1: Preflight & Weekly Plan Lookup
1. Locate the latest weekly plan in `temp/planner/weekly-plan-*.json` (or `.md`).
2. If no weekly plan exists, trigger `/weekly-planner` first to establish the baseline trajectory.

### Step 2: Ingest Yesterday's Closures
Run the shared engine in daily mode:
```bash
python3 skills/weekly-planner/scripts/planner_core.py --repo-root . --mode daily
```
The engine automatically:
- Scans PRs merged in the last 24–36 hours (`gh pr list --state merged`).
- Scans issues closed in the last 24–36 hours (`gh issue list --state closed`).
- Identifies which weekly milestones are now completed.

### Step 3: Re-Sequence & Promote Unblocked Work
- Open PRs are re-sorted topologically into the 4 phases (Ready to Land, Blockers to Fix, Needs Rebase, In Review).
- Newly unblocked dependent tasks are promoted to the top of today's operator queue.
- If a task is waiting on a business decision, the **Provisional Decision Protocol** is applied (fallback default + record on canonical tracking issue).

### Step 4: Adversarial Audit on the Daily Pivot
Before presenting the pivoted day plan, the engine executes the 2nd-Pass Adversarial Audit:
- **Duplication:** Checks if today's actions duplicate work in review.
- **Contradiction:** Checks if two developers are scheduled to touch colliding files today.
- **Race Condition:** Ensures long-running migrations/backfills aren't scheduled over concurrent sync jobs.

### Step 5: Output Daily Action Queue
Outputs a concise, 1-day focus sheet:
1. **Accomplished Yesterday:** Landed PRs and closed items.
2. **Today's Immediate P0 Blocker:** The single item the operator should clear first.
3. **Today's Teammate Action Queues:** Focused tasks for each member.
4. **Active Merge Sequence:** Live status of the PR queue.

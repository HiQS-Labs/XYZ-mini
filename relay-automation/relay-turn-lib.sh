# Containment contract — decisions/2026-06-15-unattended-agent-containment.md (3-model validated):
#   (1) path-allowlist      — revert + FAIL on any change outside {relay file, ALLOW_PATHS}.
#                             REVIEWER-turn scoping: when the relay file's NEXT names the Reviewer,
#                             ALLOW_PATHS is dropped (allowlist = relay file ONLY), so a headless
#                             reviewer cannot edit the artifact it is reviewing — any such edit reverts.
#   (2) commit-bypass guard — if the agent committed during its own turn: reset --hard + FAIL (in-ROOT).
#                             In a worktree-isolated turn the agent CANNOT reach ROOT's HEAD, so a moved
#                             ROOT HEAD is a CONCURRENT PEER commit — PRESERVED, not reset (GH-13).
#   (3) no push             — stage only the allowlist, commit file-scoped, never push
#   (3b) archive transcript — GH-30 Phase 3 (Model A): when XYZ_ARCHIVE_ROOT redirected the relay file
#                             into a SEPARATE git repo (the archive), rtl_init flags RTL_ARCHIVE_MODE and
#                             rtl_enforce commits the transcript into THAT repo via an isolated `git -C`
#                             step — never RTL_ROOT. Code artifacts + the .tick token stay on RTL_ROOT,
#                             so token-tree and transcript-tree can differ without the (2) reset hazard.
#                             Unset var / same-repo relay file → mode 0, byte-for-byte the paths above.
# Keeping this in ONE place means a new turn-taker (gemini-drive.sh, …) inherits the exact

# rtl_enforce deliberately `exit 6`s the calling shell on any violation — that fails the turn.
# rtl_run_bounded returns 7 on timeout; the CALLER must decide whether to continue to rtl_enforce
# (it should — a killed agent may have left off-lane changes) and then exit 7 after enforcement.
# Exit-code priority: containment violation (6) takes precedence over timeout (7). Rationale: a
# containment violation means unsafe state was left in the repo; that signal is more critical to
# surface than the mechanism (timeout) that caused the agent to be killed. A shim that detects a
# timeout should still call rtl_enforce, and if rtl_enforce exits 6 the process exits 6 — correct.
# If rtl_enforce completes without violation the shim then exits 7 to report the timeout.

  # GH-160: a VENDORED .xyz/ install's own $1 (codex-turn.sh/agy-turn.sh's default ROOT, used
  # whenever marathon-drive/relay-drive don't export CODEX_TURN_ROOT/AGY_TURN_ROOT — they never do)
  # is the .xyz/ SUBDIR itself, not the repo it's vendored into — even with NO --target-root at all
  # (the GH-51 block above only runs when RELAY_TARGET_ROOT is set). Left uncorrected, RTL_ROOT
  # anchors containment at .xyz/: the repo-root-relative strip below never matches an ABSOLUTE
  # relay-file path (it isn't under .xyz/), so the relay file's own turn-append fails its off-lane
  # match — and rtl_worktree_begin's `-e "$RTL_ROOT/$a"` seed check for every OTHER allowlisted
  # artifact resolves under .xyz/ too, finds nothing there, and deletes the artifact from the
  # worktree handed to the agent (the "codex says the worktree doesn't contain my files" symptom —
  # codex was telling the truth). Unconditional (not gated on RELAY_TARGET_ROOT, unlike the GH-51
  # block above): whenever RTL_ROOT is not itself the toplevel of the git repo it resolves into —
  # i.e. it is some ancestor's subdirectory, exactly the vendored-.xyz shape — collapse to that
  # toplevel. A normal (non-vendored) RTL_ROOT already IS its own toplevel, so this is a no-op there.
  # STRING-based, not `rev-parse --show-toplevel` (physical path, e.g. /private/var): the relay file
  # and artifact paths are built by the CALLER from RTL_ROOT's own (possibly symlinked, e.g. /var)
  # string form, so correcting to the physical toplevel would just move the mismatch — the relay
  # file's absolute prefix would then fail to strip against a /private/var-rooted RTL_ROOT instead of
  # a .xyz-rooted one (caught live: an early version of this fix did exactly that). `--show-prefix`
  # gives the repo-root-relative form of RTL_ROOT itself; stripping that suffix off RTL_ROOT's own
  # string yields the toplevel in RTL_ROOT's OWN symlink form, matching what the rest of the turn uses.
  #
  # GH-417 — scope of the warning above. It is about THIS collapse, which runs BEFORE the GH-261
  # normalization below and would therefore change RTL_ROOT's symlink form while the allowlist is
  # still holding the caller's. It is NOT a verdict on `--show-toplevel` generally, and in particular
  # not on utils/py/rtl.py:resolve_turn_root, which defaults ROOT to exactly that construct on purpose
  # (GH-296) and is safe doing so: GH-261 (312a2c3) canonicalizes BOTH RTL_ROOT and each absolute
  # allowlist entry to physical form before stripping, so by then either form resolves. The two
  # statements read as a contradiction for three weeks and cost Marathon Plan K's Wave 1 a wrong
  # root-cause; 312a2c3's own message names the test/marathon-drive.sh GH-171/GH-172 failures Plan K
  # measured two days earlier and could not explain. test/gh417-turn-root-symlink-prefix.sh pins all

# --- Worktree isolation (ROADMAP Part A Phase 3.6 — the airtight async/side-effect close) ----------
# Before touching anything below: read WORKTREE-SAFETY.md (repo root) — it documents the
# git-worktree footguns and the safe recovery path for a corrupted RTL_ROOT/.git (GH-177). This is
# the one place in the harness that runs `git worktree add`/cleanup at runtime; every turn shim
# (aider/agy/codex/claude-turn.sh) and consult.sh reach worktree isolation through this file.
# OPT-IN: callers gate on RELAY_WORKTREE_ISOLATION=1. Default OFF → behaviour is unchanged.
# Run the agent turn in a THROWAWAY git worktree of RTL_ROOT@HEAD, so any async/background write
# lands in a tree we delete — RTL_ROOT is never the agent's target. This closes the gap left by the
# point-in-time `rtl_enforce` + the (macOS-absent) setsid process-group reap: ROOT safety no longer
# depends on killing the process group, because the agent can't reach ROOT in the first place.
# Coordination state (.tick) stays SHARED — the caller must run the agent with TICK_REPO_ROOT=RTL_ROOT.
#
# SEED LIMITATIONS (relay review 2026-06-23 F4/F5 — known constraints, documented; structural fix deferred):
#   - Cross-repo / uncommitted artifact: the worktree is a checkout of RTL_ROOT@HEAD and seeds only
#     allowlisted paths UNDER RTL_ROOT (below). An artifact in ANOTHER repo, or a brand-new uncommitted
#     one, is neither at HEAD nor on the writable allowlist, so it would be invisible to an isolated turn.
#     FIX (GH-31 / closes #15): set RELAY_ARTIFACT_FILE (relay-drive `--artifact-file`) to seed it as a
#     READ-ONLY artifact at .relay-artifacts/<basename> — the read-only seed set distinct from the writable
#     allowlist. The reviewer may READ it; an edit changes its signature and fails the turn (strict-fail);
#     it is never copied back to RTL_ROOT (no leak). See rtl_init (RTL_ARTIFACT) + the seed/exempt logic
#     in rtl_worktree_begin/end. (Embedding inline still works for callers who prefer it.)
_rtl_sig() {  # <path> — content signature of a file/dir, or "ABSENT". Used to detect what the turn
  # actually changed IN THE WORKTREE, so rtl_worktree_end copies back ONLY worktree-modified paths and
  # never clobbers a ROOT-direct edit with a stale seed (GH-22). git is already required by this lib.

# GH-141 — recoverability-only mitigation for the concurrent peer-edit race.
#
# rtl_check CANNOT distinguish "a peer session's concurrent mid-turn edit" from "the agent's own
# off-lane self-escape": both produce byte-identical porcelain diffs, and rtl_before's snapshot is
# taken once at turn start, so anything that turns dirty DURING the turn window looks identical.
# Any fix of the shape "don't revert a newly-dirty non-allowlisted path" would silently disable
# rtl_enforce's documented backstop against the already-observed GH-22 self-escape vector.
#
# So the revert DECISION IS DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED. This only copies the pre-revert content aside
# first, turning "not recoverable in general" (GH-141's live 2026-07-05 incident, and a second
# occurrence on 2026-07-18) into a recoverable one. Mirrors the refs/relay-orphan/<sha> pattern
# rtl_enforce already uses for the moved-HEAD case. Backups land under .tick/, which rtl_check

# GH-113 — relocate, don't fail, the headless builder's root-level scratch.
#
# The observed incident (marathon/daybreak-wave-2, 2026-08-20): the agy builder wrote fix_lens1.py /
# test_lens6.py / tmp.json into the working-tree ROOT while debugging, rtl_check reverted them at
# exit 6, and a turn whose actual lane work was fine died on incidental scratch. Prose in the prompt
# is not a guarantee the builder model weights, so this is the mechanical half of the fix: a
# scratch-SHAPED write is moved into the sanctioned scratch lane and the turn proceeds.
#
# Deliberately NARROW — this is a room, not an amnesty (same line GH-91 drew for .relay-scratch):
#   - ROOT-LEVEL only (no "/" in the path): the incident shape is a transient script dropped in the
#     tree root; a nested off-lane path is a lane mistake, not scratch, and still violates.
#   - UNTRACKED only: an edit to a TRACKED file is an off-lane content change whatever its name —
#     the GH-22 self-escape backstop must keep biting there (GH-113 acceptance pins this).
#   - NAME must look like transient scratch (tmp*/temp*/scratch*/debug*/test_*/fix_*/repro_*/probe_*
#     prefix, or *.tmp/*.temp/*.bak/*.orig/~ suffix). "offlane.md" and friends still violate.
# The destination is .tick/scratch/ (exempted intrinsically, never rides into a commit, recoverable

#   RTL_CLAIM_WORD_RE — free-form phrasing a model might use INSTEAD of the [Pass] tag to assert
#                        correctness. Widened 2026-07-08 from a 3-word list ([Pass]/verified/
#                        confirmed) — that list let an assertion like "looks good, no issues, ship
#                        it" bypass the backstop entirely (none of the 3 tokens present), undermining
#                        the "mechanical, not prompt-compliance-dependent" premise for any vocabulary
#                        outside that short list. The [Pass] TAG itself is deliberately NOT folded
#                        into this variable — see the warning below.
#   RTL_CITATION_RE    — a quoted span ("..."/`...`) or a file:line reference (name:NNN).
# WARNING — do not add `\[Pass\]` (or any other backslash-escaped literal) to either of these
# strings. Both are passed to awk via `-v` and matched as a DYNAMIC regex (`line ~ var`); macOS's
# default /usr/bin/awk ("one true awk") string-unescapes a -v value before compiling it as a regex,
# which silently turns the literal string \[Pass\] into the bracket EXPRESSION [Pass] — i.e. "any
# single P, a, or s character" — matching almost every line instead of the literal tag. Caught in
# review of this very follow-up (the widened-vocabulary tests below false-matched an unrelated
# [Blocker] line and a bare "RECOMMENDATION: ship" line). Reproduce with:
#   printf 'xyz\n' | awk -v re='\[Pass\]' '$0 ~ re {print "false match: " $0}'   # prints on macOS awk
# The [Pass] tag check MUST stay an inline `/\[Pass\]/` literal in each awk SCRIPT below (not a -v
# value) — inline /regex/ delimiters are compiled directly, bypassing the -v string-unescape step.

"""Attribution for a timed-out turn — why exit 7 happened, not just that it did.

A turn shim caps its agent on wall-clock and reports exit 7. That number alone
cannot distinguish outcomes that need opposite responses:

  - the agent was genuinely slow            -> raise the turn budget
  - the agent spun in a runaway loop        -> a real defect in the work
  - a modal OS dialog blocked the process   -> no budget will ever be enough;
                                               a human has to dismiss it

The third case is not hypothetical. A target repo that reads credentials through
the macOS keyring (``keyring.get_password``) triggers a Keychain prompt, which is
presented by a *separate* process and blocks the caller until answered. In a
headless turn nobody answers it, so the turn burns its entire budget and dies at
the wall clock — indistinguishable in the log from an agent that was merely slow.
Observed 2026-08-02 against rebalance-OS, where a p5 turn timed out and the cause
could not be established after the fact.

This generalises past Keychain: any modal prompt in any target repo (credential
helper, ``sudo`` password, first-run trust dialog) produces the same signature.
The harness cannot prevent a target repo from doing this, but it can say so.

WHY A SAMPLER AND NOT A HANDLER. ``subprocess.run(..., timeout=N)`` kills the
child and reaps it *before* raising ``TimeoutExpired``, so by the time the shim
can react, every process that would carry the evidence is gone. Sampling has to
run alongside the turn. The thread is a daemon and every probe is wrapped, so a
probe failure degrades the verdict to ``timeout-unclassified`` and can never fail
the turn it is describing.

The exit code is deliberately unchanged: callers keep seeing 7. This adds a
reason string next to it.

Deliberately stdlib-only and cheap: one ``ps`` and one ``pgrep`` per interval, so
it stays affordable on a 30-minute turn. Network state is sampled once during live sampling, when
enough otherwise-idle observations exist. An established connection proves
that the turn may still be waiting on its backend; no connection does *not* prove
that it is wedged. If ``lsof`` is unavailable or fails, attribution degrades to
``timeout-unclassified`` and never changes the turn's exit code.

# GH-375 — agy's auth pre-flight cannot decide on exit status alone. `agy whoami` EXITS 0 while
# failing to run at all when there is no TTY ("CLI error: bubbletea: error opening TTY: ... open
# /dev/tty: device not configured"), and every marathon or driven relay turn is headless, so that is
# the NORMAL path under automation rather than an edge case. Both callers (agy-turn.py, consult.py)
# had the same shape and the same hole, so the verdict lives here once rather than in two copies
# that can drift.
#
# Matched as line PREFIXES, not as a bare "error" substring anywhere in the output. `whoami` prints
# ACCOUNT IDENTITY on success — a substring test would fail any lane whose handle, org, or banner
# happens to contain "error", and a false failure stops the run outright, which is a worse outcome
# than the bug being fixed. The TTY signature is matched separately: it is the exact shape the issue
# reports and it does not necessarily carry an error prefix.
# GH-375 follow-up. AGY_AUTH_TIMEOUT_S defaulted to 5 while `agy whoami` cost 1.3-2.3s idle on the
# reference machine — under 2x headroom, and concurrent load closed it twice. The second time was AFTER
# the timeout branch was taught to reclassify a TTY-diagnosed timeout as unverifiable: the probe was
# killed before it could FLUSH its diagnostic, so the capture was empty, the reclassification had
# nothing to match on, and the lane was blocked anyway. That flush race was predicted by one reviewer
# and dismissed by another (and by me) as bounded; it then fired in the next consult and cost the agy
# seat. Observed, so no longer a judgement call.
#
# 20s is chosen against the measurement, not by feel: ~9x the worst idle probe, which leaves room for
# the load that closed a 2x margin. The cost is bounded and lands only on a genuine interactive-login
# hang, which now takes 20s to reject instead of 5 — a rare path, and rejecting it late is cheaper than
# blocking a working lane. Same reasoning as GH-457's tiers: size a cap against what the thing actually
# costs, not against a number that looks tidy.

    that GH-375 and its follow-up were written against. It no longer exits 0 with a TTY error and it
    no longer prints one promptly. `whoami` is not a subcommand in this version at all — the
    subcommand list is agent/agents/changelog/help/install/mcp/models/plugin/plugins/update — so the
    argument falls through to the INTERACTIVE TUI, which writes its terminal-takeover sequences and
    then blocks. It also ignores SIGTERM: `timeout 8 agy whoami` was measured still alive at 248s.

    So the capture at timeout is a run of escape codes and no text. Under the pre-existing rule that
    is "a timeout with no TTY diagnostic" -> fatal, and the agy lane is blocked on a machine where
    `agy -p` answers correctly in 14s. That is precisely the false-block direction GH-375 and its

    instead of English. The second half of the test is what keeps case (3) intact: if anything
    READABLE survives stripping, this is not a mute takeover. A device-code login prompt has
    readable text, so it still lands on fatal, which is the branch's original purpose.

    severity is one of:
      ""              — nothing suspicious; treat the probe as passed.
      "unverifiable"  — the probe COULD NOT RUN, so it established nothing either way. Report it
                        loudly; do NOT fail the lane on it.
      "failed"        — the probe ran and agy reported an error. Fail the lane.

    THE THIRD STATE IS THE WHOLE POINT, and it was learned the expensive way. GH-375's suggested fix
    was to treat the TTY error as a failed probe and stop the turn. That was implemented literally and
    it broke the agy lane outright: test/relay-self-sufficiency.sh went 4/0 to 0/4 with `agy shim
    exited 5`, on a machine where agy was signed in and working.

    The measurement that settles it, taken on this repo:

      * `agy whoami` cannot run headless at all. It exits 0 while printing
        `CLI error: bubbletea: error opening TTY: ... /dev/tty: device not configured`.
      * `agy -p` — the print mode the ACTUAL turn uses — runs headless perfectly well. The live turn
        in relay-self-sufficiency.sh claims its token, writes the relay file and commits.

    So a TTY error from `whoami` says nothing about whether auth works; it says this probe is the
    wrong instrument in this environment. Treating it as failure converts an unmeasurable check into
    a hard block on a lane that demonstrably works — strictly worse than the bug GH-375 reported,
    which merely let a possibly-unauthed lane proceed. One of two working builders, stopped by its
    own guard.

    What GH-375 established stands and is preserved: exit status alone cannot decide this, and the
    captured output must not be deleted. Those were the real defects. The inference "the probe could
    not run, therefore auth is bad" is the part that does not follow.

    A separate function from agy_auth_output_verdict on purpose. That one reads an output stream from
    a process that EXITED, where "nothing suspicious" legitimately means pass. A timeout has no exit
    status to interpret, and silence there is not reassurance — so this function never returns the
    pass verdict, and reusing the other one here would have converted a hung probe into a green one.

    GH-375 follow-up. The three-state fix covered `whoami` EXITING with a TTY error. It did not cover
    the probe blowing its timeout, which still went straight to fatal — and that is the branch that
    actually fired: a /consult on 2026-08-09 lost its agy seat to

        consult: agy auth pre-flight timed out after 5s; likely expired auth opening an interactive
                 login. Run `agy login` in a normal terminal, then retry.

    on a machine where, measured in the same minute, `agy whoami` printed the TTY error and `agy -p`
    (what the turn actually uses) answered correctly. A false block, from the guard, on a working lane
    — the same failure direction GH-375's own fix was written to avoid, one branch over.

    The rule: reclassify ONLY on positive evidence of the TTY cause. If the captured output already
    says agy could not open a TTY, the timeout carries no more information about auth than the fast
    failure did — on a platform where `whoami` can never succeed headlessly, a timeout is just a
    slower spelling of the same thing. Anything else — an interactive login prompt, an unfamiliar
    error, or NO output at all — stays fatal, which keeps the branch's original purpose intact for a
    genuine hang on a login prompt.

    Deliberately narrower than "a timeout is unverifiable". That broader rule would also swallow the
    real hang this branch exists to catch, and silence is exactly the shape a login prompt waiting on
    stdin produces.

    """GH-409: give the claim we just took a guaranteed release, on every exit path.

    The claim is taken here, several hundred lines before the turn's own cleanup. `rtl_enforce` is
    what normally releases or hands it off — but a shim can exit long before reaching it: worktree
    setup fails (`sys.exit(5)`), containment rejects the turn (`sys.exit(6)`), a derivation call
    fail-fasts, an exception escapes. On any of those the claim simply stays held.

    That is not a cosmetic leak, because an agent may hold only two (MAX_ACTIVE_CLAIMS_PER_AGENT).
    TWO such failures wedge that agent permanently, and the wedge is self-inflicted, does not clear
    itself, and reports itself as a problem with the NEXT token rather than with the earlier turns.
    GH-432 fixed the neighbouring half — a failed *agent* now reaches enforce — but the paths above
    never consult the agent's result at all, so they were untouched by it.

    IDEMPOTENT BY CONSTRUCTION, and that is the load-bearing property. It re-reads `tick info` and
    releases only if the task is STILL claimed by us at exit. After a normal turn the token has
    already been released to the peer (GH-67 handoff) or marked done, so this sees `status: open` /
    `done` and does nothing — it cannot clobber a handoff a successful turn just made. Blanket
    releasing would.

    Deliberately a RELEASE and not a `reap`. Reaping is the watchdog's authority path for someone
    else's dead claim; this process is the legitimate owner cleaning up after itself, and the
    distinction is worth keeping in the event log. Equally deliberately, nothing here auto-reaps on a
    cap error: silently stealing a claim would trade a loud stall for a race against an agent that is
    genuinely busy (the issue's own non-goal).

    SIGKILL and a host panic are out of reach — atexit cannot run — and stay the watchdog's job.
